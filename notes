things that did't make it:
- xcpretty
- things
- airdrop toggling
- git link
- git autofix (use fixup and autosquash)
- neovim

consider separate os x config repo for non dotfile stuff?

git diff-highlight isn't installed on ubuntu by default, we're using diffr
instead, but not yet automatically installing it on linux

future improvements:
- vim fzf respect gitignore and ignore un~ files
- autocomplete from tmux buffers

notes for cloud workstation:

persistent disk created manually?

provisioning:
- pass in disk name, create instance
- auto clone dotfiles and install
- run additional script for package installation
- that's it?
