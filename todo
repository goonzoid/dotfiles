FRONTEND:
vim plugins for html/jsx:
- https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim
- https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag
- https://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagalong.vim

GENERAL:
bat: deafult colour scheme and other settings
figure out an easy way to resize splits - https://github.com/simeji/winresizer seems to be the least bad
remaps from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=548s look pretty great
better matching of pairs + highlighting: andymass/vim-matchup (needs highlighting off by default + nice toggle mapping)

SUPERCOLLIDER:
eventually revisit https://madskjeldgaard.dk/posts/neovim-as-sc-ide/
