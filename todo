FRONTEND:
vim plugins for html/jsx:
- https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim
- https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag
- https://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagalong.vim

GENERAL:
color tweaks for statusbar and split dividers - see https://gist.github.com/romainl/379904f91fa40533175dfaec4c833f2f
bat: deafult colour scheme and other settings
figure out how to use signify to show diffs of git changes (or try https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)
figure out an easy way to resize splits - https://github.com/simeji/winresizer seems to be the least bad
remaps from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=548s look pretty great
better matching of pairs + highlighting: andymass/vim-matchup (needs highlighting off by default + nice toggle mapping)

SUPERCOLLIDER:
how to make C-j in insert mode leave insert mode?
